# CodeCrate

A small personal toolset for scaffolding tiny project templates quickly. The idea is to keep lightweight scripts I tend to reuse when starting small experiments.

Includes a simple CLI to create folders, README, and license placeholders.

Usage

- Install in editable mode or just run directly with Python.
- Example: `python -m crate.scaffold demo-app` creates `demo-app/` with starter files.
